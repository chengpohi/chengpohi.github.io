# Scratches

The Scratches node is a valuable feature within the EDQL (Elasticsearch Data Query Language) ecosystem that offers a sandbox environment for experimentation and exploration. Designed to facilitate rapid prototyping and ad-hoc querying, the Scratches node provides a dynamic space where you can interactively test and refine your EDQL queries without affecting your main data or indexes.
