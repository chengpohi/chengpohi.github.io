description: Visual Editor for Help Quickly Generate Elasticsearch Query DSL in EDQL
---

# Visual Editor

Always complex Query DSL syntax is hard to learn and remember, DSL is also not easy to view if we only want to query by some simple conditions, example: must, must\_not, term, terms, range etc.

So EDQL has implemented a powerful feature for visualize write query conditions by using interactive Visual Editor.&#x20;

EDQL visual editor can help quickly generate Elasticsearch Query DSL with visual configurations, we just need to set the query type, filed name and field value. after these we can directly run this Query Action on Visual Editor, also if we switch back to script mode, the generated Query DSL also will be synced.

## Switch in Visual Editor

Create Visual Action

Add Query Condition

Delete Query Condition
