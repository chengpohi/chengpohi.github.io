# Chat Query Elasticsearch and Run Chat Query Based on ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo Model

Are you tired of memorizing complex Elasticsearch query DSL syntax? Do you wish there was an easier way to query Elasticsearch? Look no further than the Elasticsearch Query Plugin EDQL, which now features a new Chat Query Elasticsearch capability powered by ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo.

With the Chat Query Elasticsearch feature, users can now query Elasticsearch using natural language in a chat format. This means that users can simply ask ChatGPT a question about the data they want to retrieve, and the plugin will generate the appropriate Elasticsearch query DSL. The Chat Query Elasticsearch feature is especially helpful for users who are new to Elasticsearch or who don't want to spend time memorizing complex query syntax.

The Chat Query Elasticsearch feature uses the ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo model to understand user queries and generate the appropriate Elasticsearch query DSL. This means that the plugin is smart and can generate complex queries based on the context of the conversation. Additionally, the chat query feature supports context, which means that users can start by querying an index, such as "query index my-index," and then add more details to the query using natural language, such as "field=222." The plugin will generate the complete query DSL based on the chat context.
