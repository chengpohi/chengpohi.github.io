EDQL export feature offers several convenient options to customize and optimize your export process:

1. Scroll Download: With scroll download functionality, you can export large result sets that exceed the maximum number of rows displayed on the screen. This ensures that you can export complete query results, even if they span multiple pages.
2. Download by Run Action: By simply clicking the run icon, you can initiate the export process and download the current result table directly. This quick and intuitive action saves you time and streamlines the export workflow.
3. Visual Editor Download: The visual editor in EDQL provides a user-friendly interface for crafting queries. With the export feature integrated into the visual editor, you can effortlessly export query results while working on your queries.
4. Format Options: EDQL supports multiple export formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON. When exporting to CSV and Excel formats, noise data such as "\_hits" and "took" will be automatically removed, ensuring cleaner and more focused exported data.

The EDQL export feature now includes an automatic folder reveal functionality, simplifying the process of accessing your exported Elasticsearch data. After initiating the export, the plugin automatically reveals the destination folder where the exported files are saved.

With this automated folder reveal, you can seamlessly navigate to the exported data without the need to manually search for the destination folder.&#x20;
